Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

OrderedCount("abracadabra") == []Tuple{Tuple{'a', 5}, Tuple{'b', 2}, Tuple{'r', 2}, Tuple{'c', 1}, Tuple{'d', 1}}

// Where
type Tuple struct {
    Char  rune
    Count int
}
