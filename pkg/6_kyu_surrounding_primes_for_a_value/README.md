If n is a prime number it will give two primes, n will not be included in the result.

Let's see some cases:

prime_bef_aft(100) == [97, 101]

prime_bef_aft(97) == [89, 101]

prime_bef_aft(101) == [97, 103]
Range for the random tests: 1000 <= n <= 200000

(The extreme and special case n = 2 will not be considered for the tests. Thanks Blind4Basics)

Happy coding!!
